EduPort is a platform for local tuition/coaching classes to organize and manage the data of the students and to interact with them formally.

As we all have different platforms for our schools/universities where all the information like notices, report cards, assignments, etc. is uploaded. 

EduPort provides a similar platform for local tuition classes. The teacher can create a "class" that will have a unique code to be given to the students so that they can join the class and access everything. 

In this way, all the data can be organized. It has different features like adding homework, notices, reports. It also allows teachers to schedule classes and take tests all through a single platform.
All these services will be provided for free on our platform. 

The interface of EduPort is made in such a way that it is user-friendly and the teacher does not have to put any extra effort to customize or design the website.
